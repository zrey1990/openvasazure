## Cybersecurity Vulnerability Management Project
- Set up a secure Azure network with an OpenVAS Vulnerability Management Scanner VM.
- Developed a vulnerable Windows 10 VM, featuring outdated software and disabled security controls.
- Performed unauthenticated and credentialed vulnerability scans using OpenVAS.
- Analyzed scan results, highlighting the difference between unauthenticated and credentialed scans.
- Remediated identified vulnerabilities, verified successful remediation through subsequent scans.
- Created a list of remediable vulnerabilities to simulate realistic vulnerability remediation scenarios.
